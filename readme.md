# Overview

Pop ups are huge right now. But the only way you can know about them is to check EVERY one of your favorite shops and restaurants on the off chance they MIGHT have an event today. Nobody has time for that - especially when pop ups only give you a couple hours notice and last for about 2 minutes. 

Atlanta Pop Ups takes all that guesswork out of the picture. It does all the work of finding pop ups for you so all you have to worry about is which event you're checking out.

The landing page - this is what you'll see when you first come to the site. All the pop ups in Atlanta will be listed here along with the option to either create your own or narrow down the list by location or by pop up category (food or clothing).

The individual pop up page - this is what you'll see when you click on any particular pop up. You will be able to see all the details of the pop up and have the opportunity to either edit the information or delete the pop up entirely.
